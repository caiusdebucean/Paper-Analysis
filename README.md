# Papers Personal Analysis
This is a repo for documents I have done concerning **reproduction** and **analysis** on _SoTA_ papers at the moment of their creation in time.

The format and extension of the documents are ever-changing and only representative of my personal formatting choices as I try to learn the craft and do a better job.

An observation can be made to the fact that I like to refer to myself in _plural_, in hopes of finding an interested party in partaking this past-time activity.

_Honorable mentions_:
* **Pix2PixHD** - _Image Reconstruction using GANs_ - reproduction paper used to apply for EEML2019 and reviewed positively, which I have lost in space and time and cannot find on any email, cloud or local drive.

Disclaimer: _The documents might include up to 30% of text from the respective paper, as the explanations taken could not be reproduced in better words, and the documents are relevant to the fact that these writings are of personal academic interest. Use of these outside personal interest or otherwise give me zero liability for any event._
