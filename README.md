# Papers Personal Analysis
This is a repo for documents I have done concerning **reproductions** and **analyses** on _SoTA_ papers at the moment of their creation in time. _Because of differences in Markdown Preview and actual GitHub Visual Interface, there will be a multitude of small corrective commits done on the fly._

The format and extension of the documents are ever-changing and only representative of my personal formatting choices as I try to learn the craft and do a better job. These analyses will range between mere synopses *(shorter and more concise)* and bold reproduction papers *(detailed and dissected)*.

An observation can be made to the fact that I like to refer to myself in _plural_, in hopes of finding an interested party in partaking this past-time activity.

Papers reviewed _so far_:

**1. R-CNN**, **Fast R-CNN** and **Faster R-CNN** *(Object detection)*

**2. YOLO** *(Real-Time Object detection)*

**3. YOLACT** *(Real-Time Instance Segmentation)*

**4. FCOS** *(One-Stage Object Detection)* **-in progress-**

**5. CenterMask** *(Real-Time Anchor-Free Instance Segmentation)* **-in progress-**



_Honorable mentions_:
* **Pix2PixHD** - _Image Reconstruction using GANs_ - reproduction paper used to apply for *EEML2019* and reviewed positively, which I have lost in space and time and cannot find on any email, cloud or local drive.
* **Pix2Vox** - _3D object Reconstruction from RGB single-shot and multi-shot images_ - the paper that started my pursue of overcoming the SotA on the *3D-R2N2* Dataset
Disclaimer: _The documents might include up to 30% of text from the respective paper, as the explanations taken could not be reproduced in better words, and the documents are relevant to the fact that these writings are of personal academic interest. Use of these outside personal interest or otherwise give me zero liability for any event. Moreover, they are written to the best of my academic understanding meaning that misjudgements may appear._
